Micromobility devices are achieving increased adoption all over the world, and the number of riders is expected to grow 10% per year every year this decade. 
However, more and more riders are concerned about the safety of their e-scooters and e-bikes. In 2021 alone, over 80,000 emergency medical visits were related to
by micromobility devices, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 

That's where RideShield comes in. RideShield offers an Arduino device that riders can attach to micromobility vehicles. The hardware device takes pictures of the area
and feeds them to AWS, where they are analyzed to determine how safe the surroundings are for micromobility usage. These findings are then used to power a 
safety-aware routing app to keep riders out of danger.
